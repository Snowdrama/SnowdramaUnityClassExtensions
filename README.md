# Snowdrama Unity Class Extensions
A package of extension methods I use for various things

Some examples include:
* Float.Remap - to remap a value from one range to another
* Vector2.AngleFromVector - get an angle in degrees from a vector
* Vector2.AngleFromVectorRads - for the radians fans out there
* Vector2.VectorFromAngle - get a direction vector from an angle
* LayerMask.LayerContains - for seeing if a layer mask contains certain layers

# Requirements & Disclaimer
In theory it works with earlier versions but I have tested against 2020.3.19f1(current LTS version) but I have it set to work with 2019.1

# Installation
* To install this package, use the Unity Package manager and click the + in the upper left.
